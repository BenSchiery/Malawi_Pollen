drone specs: "The drone flight platform is a DJI M600, which is equipped with a direct geo-referencing unit (integrated Trimble Global Navigation Satellite System and Inertial Navigation System – GNSS/INS) for providing the position and orientation of the platform. The remote sensing unit for the platform comprises both an RGB digital camera and a high-resolution LiDAR unit: Velopdyne VLP 32C high-resolution LiDAR unit and a high-resolution and Sony α 7 RIII RGB camera. The VLP 32C unit is capable of emitting 600 – 1,200 thousand pulses per second with a measurement range of up to 200m while the RGB camera has a sensor array with more than 40 megapixels. The LiDAR and RGB cameras are geo-referenced (i.e., their position and orientation relative to a global mapping frame are available) using an Applanix APX V3 GNSS/INS unit. The data processing provides positional accuracy at the 2-3 inch level while flying at 150ft above ground."
